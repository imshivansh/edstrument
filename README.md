# Edstruments Project

This project is an assessment for Edstruments, developed using Spring Boot. It includes setup for data access via JPA, a web interface, and in-memory database testing with H2. This README provides instructions on how to set up, run, and test the application.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:
- JDK 17
- Maven 3.6 or later
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA (optional, but recommended for ease of use with Spring Boot)

## Setting Up the Project

### Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

mvn spring-boot:run
This command will download all necessary dependencies, compile the project, and start the Spring Boot application.
server will start running on port 8080.

I have also shared the Postman collection via email to test APIs.
